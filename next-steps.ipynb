      "To show that your code works as expected and to ensure that it will continue to work in the future, you should write a test for your new module. Such test can be written in as an general script in Python or Bash and there is also Python [doctest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html) package to test small portions of code in the module. However, in GRASS GIS version 7.1, there will be a dedicated Python package [gunittest](http://grass.osgeo.org/grass71/manuals/libpython/gunittest_testing.html) which contains functions to make testing of GRASS GIS modules as convenient as possible. The `grass.gunittest` package is currently available in the trunk (the development version).\n",
      "\n",
      "The tests are written as function (method) of a class which inherits from `TestCase` available in `grass.gunittest.case` package. Test function name must start with `test_`. There can be one or more of these `test_` functions. We use `assertModule()` function to call module we are testing with given parameters and we expect the process to finish successfully. The `runModule()` function is used to call modules we are not testing. Functions `setUp()` and `tearDown()` are called before and after every call of the `test_` functions. We don't have to delete the created maps (using `g.remove`), although it might be advantageous to do that as well as using unique names within one class.\n",
